# ***Liqube Dark Code Theme*** for VSCode

# Introduction

A fresh and stylish **dark theme** for *Visual Studio Code*, designed to be **less colorful**, **less distracting**, but **much more focused** than other themes.
While specifically created for **evening/night coding** the color scheme also works fine for day-time work.

This theme was made with *C*, *C++*, *PHP*, *HTML*, *CSS*, and *LUA* in mind, but should work fine for most languages.

# Design Specifics

The idea was to put focus on elements that are relevant, that need to be identifyable quickly without
having the brain do the exhausting work of visually separating things.

**Strings** and **characters** are kept in a single consistent color, and across regular expressions.

**Operators** are dimmed to keep the focus on what is going on around them.

**Brackets** are mostly dimmed, except where they need to be highly visible (e.g., *function calls*.)

**Variables** and **function calls** use two separate colors.

**HTML elements** use a distinct pink tint to effectively separate them from script code, which also translates to **CSS** files.

**Comments** are dimmed gray and stay in the background, as they should. They do not make use of a specific color in order to not steal focus.

**Bracket matching** are visualized in black to avoid introducing yet another highlight color.

And several other things I simply forgot to mention here.
